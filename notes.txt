TODO:
 * allow selection of IP address (and network interface)

 * hint at wifi SSID somehow?

 * improve visual effects for UI (e.g. clear the terminal before/after)

 * abstract out selecting from a list of keys; it is a very similar
   workflow for imported keys as for selecting keys to export.

 * add zbarcam-style client work.
