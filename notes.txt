TODO:

 * integrate with gpgme just input needed): import to ephemeral
   homedir, examine, then prompt the user whether to import it or now.

 * if we are going to send the double newlines, cork and uncork gnutls
   before sending the newline.  this also means implementing
   gnutls_transport_set_push_function()

 * allow selection of IP address (and network interface)

 * improve visual effects for UI (e.g. clear the terminal before/after)
